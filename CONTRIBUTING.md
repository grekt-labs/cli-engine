# Contributing to grekt cli-engine

grekt cli-engine is **available source** under the [Business Source License 1.1](./LICENSE). The source code is public for transparency, learning, and community involvement — but this is not a traditional open-source project with open governance.

## How to contribute

### Feature requests and ideas

Feature requests are welcome and encouraged. Open an issue describing:

- **What** you want to achieve
- **Why** it matters for your workflow
- **Context** about your use case

Requests that align with the project roadmap will be prioritized. Even if a feature doesn't fit immediately, it helps shape the direction of the project.

### Bug reports

Found a bug? Open an issue with:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, runtime, cli-engine version)

Clear bug reports are incredibly valuable.

### Pull requests

This project follows a **maintainer-driven development model**. Pull requests are accepted under strict conditions:

**Accepted PRs:**

- Bug fixes with a clear, minimal diff
- Typo corrections and documentation fixes
- Small, focused improvements (performance, error messages, edge cases)

**Not accepted:**

- Large refactors or architectural changes
- New features without prior discussion and approval
- PRs that introduce new dependencies
- Changes that alter the project's direction or design philosophy

If you want to contribute code, **open an issue first** to discuss the change. This avoids wasted effort on both sides.

### Prompt requests

If you have an idea for a change but don't want to write the code yourself, you can open an issue tagged as a **prompt request** — describe the change you want in detail, and the maintainer will evaluate and implement it if it fits.

## What this is NOT

This is not a community-governed project. The roadmap, architecture, and final decisions are made by the maintainer. Contributions are appreciated, but the project's direction is not up for debate through PRs.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and direct. No drama, no politics, no passive-aggressiveness. We're here to build good software.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same [BSL 1.1](./LICENSE) license that covers the project.
