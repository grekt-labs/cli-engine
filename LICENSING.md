# Licensing

grekt cli-engine is licensed under the [Business Source License 1.1](./LICENSE) (BSL).

If you're here wondering "can I use this?", the short answer is almost certainly **yes**.

## What you CAN do

- **Use grekt** in your personal or commercial projects
- **Use grekt internally** at your company, team, or organization
- **Read, study, and learn** from the source code
- **Fork and modify** for your own use
- **Contribute** to the project

## What you CANNOT do

- Take this code and build a **competing AI artifact manager**
- Offer grekt's functionality as part of a **commercial service that replaces grekt**

That's it. That's the only restriction.

## After 2 years

Each version automatically converts to the **MIT License** two years after its release. After that, there are no restrictions at all.

## In doubt?

If you're using grekt to manage your AI artifacts, you're fine. If you're a solo developer, a startup, or a company using grekt as a tool — you're fine.

The restriction exists solely to prevent someone from taking this code and selling it as their own competing product.

## Need a commercial license?

If your use case doesn't fit the BSL terms, reach out and we'll figure it out.
